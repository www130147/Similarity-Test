This file is along with my paper published at iScience, titled "Correlative multiscale 3D imaging of mouse primary and metastatic tumors by sequential light sheet and confocal fluorescence microscopy"
There are two files and I use them for testing the simiarlity between different kinds of origial files. 
For the one named "Body Frame", I used it for the image having the original whole object. I used ImageJ to crop some background dark region prior to running the image through this code.
for the one named "Outline_Hu", I used it for the image I previoyly processed in the ImageJ where I extracted the edge of the object by "Outline" module.
