This repository accompanies my paper published in iScience titled:
“Correlative multiscale 3D imaging of mouse primary and metastatic tumors by sequential light sheet and confocal fluorescence microscopy.”

Included Code Files
	1.	Body_Frame:
This code processes images containing the original whole object. Before running the image through this code, I used ImageJ to crop some background dark regions.
	2.	Outline_Hu:
This code processes images where the object edges have been extracted. I used the “Outline” module in ImageJ to preprocess the image prior to using this code.

These files are used to evaluate the similarity between different types of processed images.
